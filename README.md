## 📚 Setup and Installation  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kundan-ksr/Object-Detector.git
   cd Object-Detector
2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Flutter installed.Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   Set Up TensorFlow Lite Model

3. **Set Up TensorFlow Lite Model**
<ul>
   <li>Download the required TensorFlow Lite model files (.tflite) and place them in the assets folder.
   <li>Update the pubspec.yaml file to include the model in your app assets.
</ul>

4. **Run the App**
Launch the app on an emulator or physical device:
   ```bash
   flutter run
